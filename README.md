# Spring Boot & MongoDb project

### Spring Boot 3, WebFlux, MongoDb (_with ReactiveCrudRepository_)

_For testing purposes a MongoDB database is created and deployed to the MongoDB cloud.
The **books-db** consists of 2 collections: **books** and **book-catalog**. Info from these collections can be fetched for all 
items or for a single item.
Sample requests:<br/>
http://localhost:8080/book-catalog <br/>
http://localhost:8080/books_
